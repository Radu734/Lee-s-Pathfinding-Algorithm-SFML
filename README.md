# Lee-s-Pathfinding-Algorithm-SFML
A 2D simulation I made to better represent how this algorithm works for new learners

# Controlls
- Left click / drag to place walls
- Hold Shift to Remove Walls
- Backspace to Remove all Walls
- Right Click to Move the Start & End Points
- "M" to Activate map of Algorithm Iterations

# I also made a game of life function
- Button to toggle it: NOT yet mapped
